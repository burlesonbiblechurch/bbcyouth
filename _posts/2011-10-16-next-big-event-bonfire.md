Start whittling your mallow roasters and come on out to Rick's place on November
19th, 2011, at 7pm for the largest* bonfire in Texas. We'll have a roaring fire
(as long as the fire ban is still lifted), worship (bring your guitar if you
have one), S'mores&reg;, a rousing game of capture the flag, and one heck of a
good time.

**Don't forget** your jacket, long johns, gloves, hat, etc., 'cause it's gonna be
_cold_ outside!

If you need directions to Rick's house, [contact us](/contact/).

_\*Bonfire may not actually be the largest in Texas. Sorry._
