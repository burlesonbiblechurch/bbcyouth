## Grace Alone

I was an orphan lost at the Fall
Running away when I'd hear Your call
But Father, You worked Your will
I had no righteousness of my own
I had no right to draw near Your throne
But Father, You loved me still
And in love before You laid the world's foundation
You predestined to adopt me as Your own
You have raised me so high up above my station
I'm a child of God by grace and grace alone

You left Your home to seek out the lost
You knew the great and terrible cost
But Jesus, Your face was set
I worked my fingers down to the bone
Nothing I did could ever atone
But Jesus, You paid my debt
By Your blood, I have redemption and salvation
Lord, You died that I might reap what You have sown
And You rose that I might be a new creation
I am born again by grace and grace alone

I was in darkness all of my life
I never knew the day from the night
But Spirit, You made me see
I swore I knew the way on my own
Head full of rocks, a heart made of stone
But Spirit, You moved in me
At your touch my sleeping spirit was awakened
On my darkened heart the light of Christ has shone
Called into a kingdom that cannot be shaken
Heaven's citizen by grace and grace alone

So I'll stand in faith by grace and grace alone
I will run the race by grace and grace alone
I will slay my sin by grace and grace alone
I will reach the end by grace and grace alone

## Alive in You

From beginning to the end
All my life is in Your hands
This whole world may hold me down
But it can never drown You out

I'm not merely flesh and bone
I was made for something more

**Chorus:**  
**You are God, You're the Great "I Am"
Breath of life I breathe You in
Even in the fire, I'm alive in You
You are strong in my brokenness
Sovereign over every step
Even in the fire, I'm alive
I'm alive in You**

Through the dark I hear Your voice
Rising up I will rejoice
For I was lost but now I'm found
'Cause even death can't hold You down

**You are God, You're the Great "I Am"
Breath of life I breathe You in
Even in the fire, I'm alive in You
You are strong in my brokenness
Sovereign over every step
Even in the fire, I'm alive
I'm alive in You**

_It's no longer I who live, but Christ who lives within me
Christ who lives within me
From beginning to the end You deserve the glory
You deserve the glory_

**You are God, You're the Great "I Am"
Breath of life I breathe You in
Even in the fire, I'm alive in You
You are strong in my brokenness
Sovereign over every step
Even in the fire, I'm alive**

**You are God, You're the Great "I Am"
Breath of life I breathe You in
Even in the fire, I'm alive in You
You are strong in my brokenness
Sovereign over every step
Even in the fire, I'm alive
I'm alive in You**

## Your Grace is Enough

Great is Your faithfulness oh God
You wrestle with the sinner's heart
You lead us by still waters and to mercy
And nothing can keep us apart

**Chorus:**  
**Your grace is enough
Your grace is enough
Your grace is enough for me**

Great is Your love and justice God
You use the weak to lead the strong
You lead us in the song of Your salvation
And all Your people sing along

**Your grace is enough
Your grace is enough
Your grace is enough for me**

_So remember Your people
Remember Your children
Remember Your promise
Oh God_

_Remember Your people
Remember Your children
Remember Your promise
Oh God_

Grace, grace God's grace
Your grace is enough for me

**Your grace is enough
Your grace is enough
Your grace is enough for me**

**Your grace is enough
Your grace is enough
Your grace is enough for me**
