title: The Big Event
---
We want to encourage all parents to join us for the "Big Event" activities.
This provides a great opportunity for families to have fun togther, get to
know the other youth's families and builds unity between the youth staff and
your families. We want our focus not to be just building into the youth, but
to help build families that follow Christ.
