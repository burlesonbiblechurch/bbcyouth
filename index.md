# Welcome to The Walk!

The Walk is the Jr. High and High School ministry of [Burleson Bible Church](http://burlesonbible.org).
We exist simply to build relationships with students and through those relationships to help the
students believe in and walk with Christ.

We do this through Sunday school, Thursday night bible study, and fun events that provide
opportunities to engage relationally with students, through which we teach Godâ€™s Word.
