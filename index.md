# Welcome to BBC Youth!

We exist simply to build relationships with students and through those
relationships to help the students believe in and walk with Christ.

We do this through [Sunday school](/sunday-school/), Wednesday night bible study ([The
Walk](/the-walk/)), and monthly events (called [The Big Event](/big-event/)) that provide
opportunities to engage relationally with students, through which we teach Godâ€™s
Word.
