  <h1>Welcome to The Walk!</h1>

  <p>The Walk is the Jr. High and High School ministry of
  <a href="http://burlesonbiblechurch.org">Burleson Bible Church</a>. We exist simply to build
  relationships with students and through those relationships to help the students believe in and walk
  with Christ.</p>

  <p>We do this through Sunday school, Thursday night bible study, and fun events that provide
  opportunities to engage relationally with students, through which we teach Godâ€™s Word.</p>

  <h3>Who is it for?</h3>

  <p>The Walk is for students in grades 7-12 (ending at graduation or 19th birthday, whichever comes
  first).</p>

  <h3>When is it?</h3>

  <p>The Walk meets on Thursdays from 7-9 at BBC. <a href="/contact">Map & Directions</a></p>
