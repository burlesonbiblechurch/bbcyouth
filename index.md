# Welcome to The Walk!

We exist simply to build relationships with students and through those
relationships to help the students believe in and walk with Christ.

We do this through Sunday school, Wednesday night bible study, and fun events that provide
opportunities to engage relationally with students, through which we teach Godâ€™s Word.
