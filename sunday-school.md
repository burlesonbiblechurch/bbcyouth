We believe that at the heart of the disciple is a solid understanding of God's
word. This doesn't come solely through being taught, but requires personal Bible
study and a love for God's word. The simple principles of "Observation,
Interpretation, Application" are what we teach for personal study and lifestyle.
To foster a love for his word and to teach these principles of Bible study we
are currently walking through the book of John making observations, learning how
to interpret and making application as we go.
