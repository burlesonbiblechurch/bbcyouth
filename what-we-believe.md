## Our mission

Our mission is to make disciples by reaching out primarily to families,
building them up with relevant worship and truth, and sending them forth to
make disciples of others. We are committed to loving everyone, excelling in
everything we do, and developing significant caring relationshiPsalm

## Our vision

Our vision is to be a grace-motivated ministry recognized for biblical
preaching and worship, bold outreach, and committed discipleship and growth.

## Our Beliefs

**The Bible.** We believe the Bible is the verbally inspired word of God
without error in the original writings and of supreme and final authority in
faith and life (2 Timothy 3:16; 2 Peter 1:21).

**The Godhead.** We believe in one God, eternally existing in three different
but equal persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (Matthew 28:19; 2 Corinthians
13:14).

**The Holy Spirit.** We believe the person of the Holy Spirit existed
eternally with the Father and the Son (John 15:26; Hebrews 9:14), and during
this present age regenerates those who believe, baptizes them into the body of
Christ, and indwells them permanently (Titus 3:5; 1 Corinthians 12:13).

**The Person of Christ.** We believe Jesus Christ existed eternally with the
Father and is wholly God (John 1:1-3; John 10:30), was conceived by the Holy
Spirit, born of the virgin Mary, and is also wholly man (Matthew 1:20-23; 1
John 4:2).

**The Saving Work of Christ.** We believe Jesus Christ died on the cross for
the sins of all people as a substitutionary sacrifice, and that He arose
bodily from the grave, ascended into heaven, and presently ministers as High
Priest for those who have trusted Him (1 Corinthians 15:3-4; Hebrews 4:14).

**The Condition for Salvation.** We believe that all human beings are sinners,
and as such are separated from God and in need of salvation (Romans 3:23;
Romans 5:12). We believe that salvation is a free gift of God’s grace provided for
all in the saving work of Jesus Christ (John 3:16; 1 John 2:2), and that any
who simply and only believe in His saving work, not in their own good works,
effort, or merit, will receive the gift of eternal life (Romans 4:5; Ephesians
2:8-9).

**The Eternal Security and Assurance of Believers.** We believe that all
believers are kept eternally secure by God’s power (John 10:27-30; Romans 8:1,
29-39), and that every believer can have absolute assurance of their salvation
through the testimony of God’s Word (John 5:24; 1 John 5:11-13) which,
however, clearly forbids the use of Christian liberty as a basis for sinful
behavior (Romans 6:1-2; Galatians 5:13).

**The Return of Christ.** We believe in the imminent, personal,
pretribulational return of Christ to rapture out His church (1 Thes. 4:14-18;
5:9), and the premillennial return of Christ with His church to Earth to
establish His kingdom (Revelation 19:11-16; Revelation 20:4-6).

**The Angelic Realm.** We believe God created angels originally holy (Psalm
148:2-5), but under the leadership of the person of Satan (1 Peter 5:8) some
now exist in a fallen state as demons (Jude 6).

**The Spiritual Gifts.** We believe that God sovereignly bestows spiritual
gifts as He pleases (1 Corinthians 12:4-11; Ephesians 4:7-11) and that such as
speaking in tongues, functioned as apostolic sign gifts, and are no longer
normative today, having fulfilled their intended purpose (1 Corinthians 13:8;
1 Corinthians 14:22; 2 Corinthians 12:12; Ephesians 2:20; Hebrews 2:3-4). We believe that
God, according to His sovereign will, does hear and answer the prayer of faith
for the sick and afflicted (John 15:7, James 5:14-15; 1 John 5:14-15).

**The Nature of the Church.** We believe that all believers in this present
age are united with the invisible Church, the body of Christ, through faith in
him as Savior (Ephesians 1:22-23; Colossians 1:18), having been placed into
the body through the baptism of the Spirit (Romans 12:4-5; 1 Corinthians
12:12-27).

**The Ordinances of the Church.** We believe water baptism and the Lord’s
Supper are the two ordinances of the church to be observed by all believers.
We believe that those who have believed in Jesus Christ as Savior should be
baptized by immersion (Acts 8:36-38) as a public identification with Christ
and a testimony of the believer’s spiritual new-birth (Matthew 28:19; Acts
16:31-33). We believe the Lord’s Supper is a symbolic remembrance of the death
and resurrection of Christ which should be observed regularly by all believers
who are walking in fellowship with Him (Luke 22:14-23; 1 Corinthians
11:23-29).

**The Eternal State.** We believe that at death the souls of those who have
trusted in Christ as Savior immediately pass into His presence (2
Corinthians 5:8; Phil. 1:23) and remain in conscious bliss until they are
joined again with their bodies in resurrection, after which they shall be with
the Lord forever (1 Corinthians 15:50-53; 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17), and that the souls
of unbelievers at death pass into conscious misery until the final judgment
when they shall be rejoined with their bodies and cast into the lake of fire
to be punished forever (Luke 16:19-28; 2 Thessalonians 1:8-9; Jude 6-7; Revelation
20:11-15).
